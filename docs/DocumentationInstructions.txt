Documentation guidelines:

VibroSim is documented using the Sphinx documentation framework. Sphinx is
capable of syntax analyis and automatic documentation generation, but due to
the way ProcessTrak steps are written this method of documetation is not used.
Every ProcessTrak step that is used in VibroSim Simulator is included in
``processtrak_steps.rst``.

The following is an example of how to document a processtrak step using the ReStructuredText system from Sphinx.

``
.. py:function:: vibrosim_synthetic_spectrum

    This ProcessTrak step will take the output of the modal analysis and
    calculate a spectrum. Each mode in the modal analysis is a peak in the
    spectrum, with the amplitude and bandwidth determined by the complex
    valued eigenfrequency.

    This ProcessTrak step is included in the ``VibroSim_Simulator`` software package.

    :param dc\:modalfreqs: |modalfreqs|
    :return dc\:modal_synthetic_spectrum: Synthetic spectrum figure.
``

Parameters for a function have this syntax:

``:param name_of_parameter: Description of parameter.``

Likewise, returns have this syntax:

``:return name_of_return: Description of return.``

In the example the description section has a simple ``|modalfreqs|`` tag. Syntax at the end of the ``.rst`` file is used to replace this flag with a description of the parameter. For example, the following code will replace every ``|modalfreqs|`` flag in the file with a string, in this case its description.

``
.. |modalfreqs| replace:: Frequencies of the eigenmodes.
``
