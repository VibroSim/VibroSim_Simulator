Tutorial
==================

Lets look in depth at ``vibrosim_demo3`` in the examples folder. This example
has three files associated with it, ``vibrosim_demo3.prx`` (processing steps),
``vibrosim_demo3.xlg`` (parameter storage), and ``vibrosim_demo3_comsol.m``
(matlab file for creating the COMSOL model).  Many ``processtrak`` steps in
VibroSim Simulator will interact with the COMSOL model, however VibroSim
Simulator itself is platform agnostic. 

``vibrosim_demo3.prx``
----------------------

The ``.prx`` file contains the processing steps to be performed with the model.
It is managed by the software tool called ``processtrak``, a part of
``Limatix``.

Use the tool in the following way:

``processtrak <args> vibrosim_demo3.prx``

The following are possible arguments.

1. ``-s <steps>`` : Run only listed steps (multiple OK) 
2. ``-a`` : Run all steps
3. ``-i`` : Use ipython interactive mode to execute script
4. ``--needed`` : Filter down steps and input files according to what "needs"
    to be run -- i.e. missing or out-of-order steps, etc. DOES NOT PERFORM
    PROVENANCE VERIFICATION

Running this command: 

``processtrak --status vibrosim_demo3.prx``

produces the following output::

    Input file: vibrosim_demo3.xlg
    ---------------------------
               copyinput NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
             dummyoutput NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
              buildmodel NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
                runmodal NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
      synthetic_spectrum NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
         entersweepfreqs NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
     setsweepfrequencies NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
          sweep_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
          enterburstfreq NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
       setburstfrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
          burst_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
    eval_closure_state_from_tip_positions NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
    calc_heating_singlefrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
       heatflow_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED

None of the steps have been run yet, so they all have the same ``NOT_EXECUTED``
and ``NEEDED`` tags. 

Now we can run the first step with the following command:

``processtrak vibrosim_demo3.prx -s copyinput``::

    Processing step copyinput on vibrosim_demo3.xlg->vibrosim_demo3.xlp

``processtrak --status vibrosim_demo3.prx``::

	Input file: vibrosim_demo3.xlg
	---------------------------
	           copyinput     2020-06-18T13:48:49.707642-05:00 
	         dummyoutput NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	          buildmodel NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	            runmodal NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	  synthetic_spectrum NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	     entersweepfreqs NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	 setsweepfrequencies NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      sweep_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      enterburstfreq NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	   setburstfrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      burst_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	eval_closure_state_from_tip_positions NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	calc_heating_singlefrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	   heatflow_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED

Now that the ``copyinput`` step has been executed, it is no longer ``needed``
and the timestamp of the step has been recorded. This data is kept in the
``.xlp`` file.

Steps can be run out of order, as long as the ``.xlp`` has everything that is needed for the step.

``processtrak vibrosim_demo3.prx -s entersweepfreqs``

``processtrak --status vibrosim_demo3.prx``::

	Input file: vibrosim_demo3.xlg
	---------------------------
	           copyinput     2020-06-18T13:48:49.707642-05:00 
	         dummyoutput NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	          buildmodel NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	            runmodal NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	  synthetic_spectrum NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
         entersweepfreqs     2020-06-18T13:53:03.368990-05:00  FAILURE NEEDED
	 setsweepfrequencies NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      sweep_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      enterburstfreq NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	   setburstfrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	      burst_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	eval_closure_state_from_tip_positions NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	calc_heating_singlefrequency NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED
	   heatflow_analysis NOT_EXECUTED NEEDED

All steps will be run from scratch if the following command is run:

``processtrak vibrosim_demo3.prx -a``

All steps with the ``NEEDED`` flag will be run with the following command:

``processtrak vibrosim_demo3.prx -a --needed``


``vibrosim_demo3.xlg``
----------------------

A ``.xlg`` contains the unprocessed experiment log. ``processtrak`` is
primarily a tool for processing data collected in an experiment, after all. It
contains all the parameters necessary to start the simulation. The first step
in a simulation is to copy the ``.xlg`` into a processed experiment log
``.xlp`` file. This new ``.xlp`` file contains all the parameters in the
``.xlg``, all parameters and results of ``processtrak`` steps, and tracking
information about when each step was run and if it completed properly.

``.xlg`` files are ``xml`` based, meaning they are hierarchical in nature. It
is a single ``experiment`` tag with multiple ``measurement`` tags. Parameters
that are consistent for a number of simulations can be stored under the
``experiment`` tag, thus making them global. These parameters can be
overwritten  in the ``measurement`` tags, allowing the user to run multiple
simulations with slightly varying input parameters. For example::

    <dc:experiment xmlns:dc="http://limatix.org/datacollect" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:dcv="http://limatix.org/dcvalue" xmlns:prx="http://limatix.org/processtrak/processinginstructions">
        <dc:measident>meas1</dc:measident> <!-- measident is used as a filename prefix for the various output files generated -->
        <dc:measurement>
            <dc:measident>meas1_direct_singlefreq</dc:measident>
            <dc:heatcalctype>singlefrequency</dc:heatcalctype>
            ...
        </dc:measurement>
        <dc:measurement>
            <dc:measident>meas1_via_weldercalc</dc:measident>
            <dc:heatcalctype>welder</dc:heatcalctype>
            ...
        </dc:measurement>
    </dc:experiment>  

``vibrosim_demo3_comsol.m``
---------------------------

This file contains all instructions necessary to build the COMSOL model for use
in VibroSim_Simulator. There are examples of this in the examples folder. In
depth information about how these files work can be found in the documentation
of the sister software package ``VibroSim_COMSOL``.
